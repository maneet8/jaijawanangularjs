    <h2 class="defaultHeader">BioDiesel Programme</h2>
    <p>
        Minister for Petroleum and Natural Gas Dharmendra Pradhan on Monday launched the marketing of high speed diesel blended with
        biodiesel at select retail outlets of public sector oil companies to mark Indias celebration of <b>World Bio Fuel Day</b>.
        Select filling stations of Hindustan Petroleum will offer the bio- diesel blended fuel in New Delhi and Vishakhapatnam
        while Bharat Petroleum will make its offering of the blended fuel in Haldia. Similarly, Indian Oil Corporation, the
        countrys biggest oil company, will market the blended diesel at select retail outlets in Vijayawada.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
        Pradhan regarded it as a path-breaking step in Indias retail sector for launching BioDiesel B5 blend for diesel consumers.The
        fuel is more eco-friendly than normal diesel. The fuel was launched as part of the green initiative by Pradhan at
        Hindustan Petroleums retail outlet in New Delhi.He also launched the sale of bio-diesel blended high speed diesel
        in other cities through live streaming from the conference hall of the MoP & NG at Shastri Bhavan in Delhi.

        Recently, the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural gas has permitted direct sale of BioDiesel (B100) to bulk consumers like
        Railways, shipping and State Road Transport Corporations. The Ethanol Blended Petrol programme (EBP) is also being
        promoted by the ministry in which ethanol blending in petrol is going up from 5-10 per cent based on the availability
        of ethanol. Pradhan said promoting and encouraging biofuels will not only reduce the import of fossil fuel but also
        save foreign exchange and emphasise on <b>Make in India</b> mission. Biofuels are renewable, biodegradable,
        sustainable and environmental friendly. More importantly, these programmes will connect agrarian community with direct
        cash flow.

        Internationally, August 10 is observed as <b>World Bio Diesel Day</b> in Germany and many other countries to mark
        the demonstration of the diesel engine by Rudolf Diesel on various vegetable oils way back in 1893. In 1900 when
        he demonstrated the engine running on groundnut oil in Paris he made a prophetic statement which reads: " My engine
        today is running on diesel but a day will come when all the fossil fuels will be over, but my The bio- diesel B 5
        blend will be sold to customers in some retail outlets of state- owned oil marketing companies engine will continue
        to run." Central Railway has also successfully completed its first year of bio-diesel production at its workshop
        at Parel in Mumbai producing nearly 20,000 litres of this green fuel with an aim to provide cleaner alternatives
        for its diesel locomotives. The workshop is reported to be producing 1,500 litres of bio-diesel per month (since
        August 2014) from edible oils and looking ahead to enhance this production, though a shortage of raw material such
        as edible oil is a hurdle.

    <h3 class="defaultHeader2">Report On BioDiesel</h3>
    <p>
        The efficacy of biodiesel as an automotive fuel is well recognized. Several countries including U.S.A. are substituting the
        conventional mineral diesel by biodiesel to address the issues of air quality and energy security. The availability
        of wastelands, presence of a variety of non-edible oil seeds and plants, prospects of development of rural economy,
        biodegradability and emission benefits are some of the positive attributes which qualify biodiesel especially its
        blends to be a prominent contender for substituting petrodiesel in India. Moreover, the technological requirements
        for process and production of biodiesel being comparatively less cumbersome and its ability to fuel an existing diesel
        vehicle with no or minor modifications also make it a promising alternate fuel.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
        In recent years several initiatives are being taken in India to bring this fuel from the fields to the wheels. The Planning
        Commission, Government of India has constituted a Committee for “ Development of biofuels” with experts from organizations
        like CPCB, IIP, MNES, IOC (R&D), etc.
    </p>

        This report presents a comprehensive view of biodiesel covering attributes like emissions, prospects of the fuel in India
        and other technological aspects.Thanks to my colleagues Dr. B. Sengupta, Member Secretary, Dr. S.A. Dutta, Sr. Project

        Till now, only state-owned oil firms and only those private firms investing Rs 2,000 crore in oil infrastructure were allowed
        to retail petrol and diesel. Biodiesel, which is to be doped in diesel before being used to fire automobiles, too
        was clubbed under this rule.

        and High Speed Diesel (diesel) control order for Regulation of Supply, Distribution and Prevention of Malpractices
        dated December 19, 2005," said an official statement here.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
        The amendment will allow private bio-diesel manufacturers, their authorised dealers and joint ventures of oil marketing companies
        (OMCs) authorised by the Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas (MoP&NG) as dealers and give marketing /distribution
        functions to them for the limited purpose of supply of bio-diesel to consumers," it said.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
        Also, the Rs 2,000 crore investment "will also be relaxed and a new clause added to give marketing rights for bio-diesel
        to the private bio-diesel manufacturers, their authorised dealers and JVs of OMCs authorised by the MoP&NG for direct
        sales to consumers", it said. The amendment was made because users faced problems in sourcing biodiesel. State-owned
        firms had their financial consideration because cost of bio-diesel was more than the refinery-gate price of diesel.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
        With the relaxation, bulk users like Railways can buy bio-diesel directly from manufacturers and dope in diesel for running
        locomotives. "This decision will encourage the production and use of bio-diesel in the country," the statement said.
        The ministry had in January 2006 announced a Bio-diesel Purchase Policy to encourage production of bio-diesel in
        the country for blending it with diesel with the objective of increasing energy security and meeting other emission
        and environment objectives.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
        Under this Policy, OMCs were to buy Bio-diesel, meeting fuel quality standard prescribed by the Bureau of Indian Standards
        (BIS), at a uniform price, as decided by the OMCs from time to time, for blending with HSD to the extent of five
        percent, at identified purchase centres across the country. "As the price of diesel is already deregulated and determined
        by the market, there is no economic justification in preventing private bio-diesel manufacturers, their authorised
        dealers and JVs of OMCs authorised by the MoP&NG from selling bio-diesel directly to consumers subject to their product
